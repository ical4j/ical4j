     *
     *     The "REQUEST" method in a "VEVENT" component provides the following
     *     scheduling functions:
     *
     *     o  Invite "Attendees" to an event.
     *
     *     o  Reschedule an existing event.
     *
     *     o  Response to a "REFRESH" request.
     *
     *     o  Update the details of an existing event, without rescheduling it.
     *
     *     o  Update the status of "Attendees" of an existing event, without
     *     rescheduling it.
     *
     *     o  Reconfirm an existing event, without rescheduling it.
     *
     *     o  Forward a "VEVENT" to another uninvited CU.
     *
     *     o  For an existing "VEVENT" calendar component, delegate the role of
     *     "Attendee" to another CU.
     *
     *     o  For an existing "VEVENT" calendar component, change the role of
     *     "Organizer" to another CU.
     *
     *     The "Organizer" originates the "REQUEST".  The recipients of the
     *     "REQUEST" method are the CUs invited to the event, the "Attendees".
     *     "Attendees" use the "REPLY" method to convey attendance status to the
     *     "Organizer".
     *
     *     The "UID" and "SEQUENCE" properties are used to distinguish the
     *     various uses of the "REQUEST" method.  If the "UID" property value in
     *     the "REQUEST" is not found on the recipient's calendar, then the
     *     "REQUEST" is for a new "VEVENT" calendar component.  If the "UID"
     *     property value is found on the recipient's calendar, then the
     *     "REQUEST" is for a rescheduling, an update, or a reconfirmation of
     *     the "VEVENT" calendar component.
     *
     *     For the "REQUEST" method, multiple "VEVENT" components in a single
     *     iCalendar object are only permitted for components with the same
     *     "UID" property.  That is, a series of recurring events may have
     *     instance-specific information.  In this case, multiple "VEVENT"
     *     components are needed to express the entire series.

    /**
     * <pre>
     * 3.2.3.  REPLY
     *
     *     The "REPLY" method in a "VEVENT" calendar component is used to
     *     respond (e.g., accept or decline) to a "REQUEST" or to reply to a
     *     delegation "REQUEST".  When used to provide a delegation response,
     *     the "Delegator" SHOULD include the calendar address of the "Delegate"
     *     on the "DELEGATED-TO" property parameter of the "Delegator's"
     *     "ATTENDEE" property.  The "Delegate" SHOULD include the calendar
     *     address of the "Delegator" on the "DELEGATED-FROM" property parameter
     *     of the "Delegate's" "ATTENDEE" property.
     *
     *     The "REPLY" method is also used when processing of a "REQUEST" fails.
     *     Depending on the value of the "REQUEST-STATUS" property, no
     *     scheduling action may have been performed.
     *
     *     The "Organizer" of an event may receive the "REPLY" method from a CU
     *     not in the original "REQUEST".  For example, a "REPLY" may be
     *     received from a "Delegate" to an event.  In addition, the "REPLY"
     *     method may be received from an unknown CU (a "Party Crasher").  This
     *     uninvited "Attendee" may be accepted, or the "Organizer" may cancel
     *     the event for the uninvited "Attendee" by sending a "CANCEL" method
     *     to the uninvited "Attendee".
     *
     *     An "Attendee" MAY include a message to the "Organizer" using the
     *     "COMMENT" property.  For example, if the user indicates tentative
     *     acceptance and wants to let the "Organizer" know why, the reason can
     *     be expressed in the "COMMENT" property value.
     *
     *     The "Organizer" may also receive a "REPLY" from one CU on behalf of
     *     another.  Like the scenario enumerated above for the "Organizer",
     *     "Attendees" may have another CU respond on their behalf.  This is
     *     done using the "SENT-BY" parameter.
     *
     *     The optional properties listed in the table below (those listed as
     *     "0+" or "0 or 1") MUST NOT be changed from those of the original
     *     request.  If property changes are desired, the "COUNTER" message must
     *     be used.

     *     instances to an existing "VEVENT" using a single iTIP message without
     *     having to send the entire "VEVENT" with all the existing instance
     *     data, as it would have to do if the "REQUEST" method were used.
     *
     *     The "UID" must be that of the existing event.  If the "UID" property

     *     The "CANCEL" method in a "VEVENT" calendar component is used to send
     *     a cancellation notice of an existing event request to the affected
     *     "Attendees".  The message is sent by the "Organizer" of the event.
     *     For a recurring event, either the whole event or instances of an
     *     event may be cancelled.  To cancel the complete range of a recurring
     *     event, the "UID" property value for the event MUST be specified and a
     *     "RECURRENCE-ID" MUST NOT be specified in the "CANCEL" method.  In
     *     order to cancel an individual instance of the event, the
     *     "RECURRENCE-ID" property value for the event MUST be specified in the
     *     "CANCEL" method.
     *
     *     There are two options for canceling a sequence of instances of a
     *     recurring "VEVENT" calendar component:
     *
     *     a.  The "RECURRENCE-ID" property for an instance in the sequence MUST
     *     be specified with the "RANGE" property parameter value of
     *     "THISANDFUTURE" to indicate cancellation of the specified
     *     "VEVENT" calendar component and all instances after.
     *
     *     b.  Individual recurrence instances may be cancelled by specifying
     *     multiple "VEVENT" components each with a "RECURRENCE-ID" property
     *     corresponding to one of the instances to be cancelled.
     *
     *     The "Organizer" MUST send a "CANCEL" message to each "Attendee"
     *     affected by the cancellation.  This can be done using a single
     *     "CANCEL" message for all "Attendees" or by using multiple messages
     *     with different subsets of the affected "Attendees" in each.
     *
     *     When a "VEVENT" is cancelled, the "SEQUENCE" property value MUST be
     *     incremented as described in Section 2.1.4.
