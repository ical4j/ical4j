     * 3.3.1.  PUBLISH
     *
     *     The "PUBLISH" method in a "VFREEBUSY" calendar component is used to
     *     publish busy time data.  The method may be sent from one CU to any
     *     other.  The purpose of the method is to provide a way to send
     *     unsolicited busy time data.  That is, the busy time data is not being
     *     sent as a "REPLY" to the receipt of a "REQUEST" method.
     *
     *     The "ORGANIZER" property MUST be specified in the busy time
     *     information.  The value is the CU address of the originator of the
     *     busy time information.
     *
     *     The busy time information within the iCalendar object MAY be grouped
     *     into more than one "VFREEBUSY" calendar component.  This capability
     *     allows busy time periods to be grouped according to some common
     *     periodicity, such as a calendar week, month, or year.  In this case,
     *     each "VFREEBUSY" calendar component MUST include the "ORGANIZER",
     *     "DTSTART", and "DTEND" properties in order to specify the source of
     *     the busy time information and the date and time interval over which
     *     the busy time information covers.

     *     ask a "Calendar User" for their busy time information.  The request
     *     may be for a busy time information bounded by a specific date and
     *     time interval.
     *
     *     This message only permits requests for busy time information.  The
     *     message is sent from a "Calendar User" requesting the busy time
     *     information of one or more intended recipients.
     *
     *     If the originator of the "REQUEST" method is not authorized to make a
     *     busy time request on the recipient's calendar system, then an
     *     exception message SHOULD be returned in a "REPLY" method, but no busy
     *     time data need be returned.
