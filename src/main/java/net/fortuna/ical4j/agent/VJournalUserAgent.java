     *
     *     The "CANCEL" method in a "VJOURNAL" calendar component is used to
     *     send a cancellation notice of an existing journal entry.  The message
     *     is sent by the "Organizer" of a journal entry.  For a recurring
     *     journal entry, either the whole journal entry or instances of a
     *     journal entry may be cancelled.  To cancel the complete range of a
     *     recurring journal entry, the "UID" property value for the journal
     *     entry MUST be specified and a "RECURRENCE-ID" property MUST NOT be
     *     specified in the "CANCEL" method.  In order to cancel an individual
     *     instance of the journal entry, the "RECURRENCE-ID" property value for
     *     the journal entry MUST be specified in the "CANCEL" method.
     *
     *     There are two options for canceling a sequence of instances of a
     *     recurring "VJOURNAL" calendar component:
     *
     *     a.  The "RECURRENCE-ID" property for an instance in the sequence MUST
     *     be specified with the "RANGE" property parameter value of
     *     "THISANDFUTURE" to indicate cancellation of the specified
     *     "VJOURNAL" calendar component and all instances after.
     *
     *     b.  Individual recurrence instances may be cancelled by specifying
     *     multiple "VJOURNAL" components each with a "RECURRENCE-ID"
     *     property corresponding to one of the instances to be cancelled.
     *
     *     When a "VJOURNAL" is cancelled, the "SEQUENCE" property value MUST be
     *     incremented as described in Section 2.1.4.
