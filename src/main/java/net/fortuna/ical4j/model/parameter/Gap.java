/**
 * <pre>
 *     Purpose:
 *     This property specifies the length of the gap, positive or negative, between two components with a temporal relationship.
 * Format Definition:
 *
 *     This parameter is defined by the following notation, where dur-value is defined in Section 3.3.6 of [RFC5545]. :
 *
 *   gapparam      = "GAP" "=" dur-value
 *
 * Description:
 *
 *     This parameter MAY be specified on the RELATED-TO property and defines the duration of time between the predecessor and successor in an interval. When positive, it defines the lag time between a task and its logical successor. When negative, it defines the lead time.
 * </pre>
 * @see <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9253.html#name-gap">rfc9253</a>
