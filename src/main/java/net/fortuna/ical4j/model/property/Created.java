 *        information was created by the calendar user agent in the calendar

 *        or &quot;VJOURNAL&quot; calendar components.
 *
 *        Description: The date and time is a UTC value.
 *
 *        Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:
 *
 *          created    = &quot;CREATED&quot; creaparam &quot;:&quot; date-time CRLF
 *
 *          creaparam  = *(&quot;;&quot; xparam)
 * </pre>
