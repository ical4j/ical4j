/**
 * $Id$
 * <p/>
 * Created: [Apr 6, 2004]
 * <p/>
 * Defines a DURATION iCalendar component property.
 * <p/>
 * <pre>
 * 3.3.6.  Duration
 *
 * Value Name:  DURATION
 *
 * Purpose:  This value type is used to identify properties that contain
 * a duration of time.
 *
 * Format Definition:  This value type is defined by the following
 * notation:
 *
 * dur-value  = (["+"] / "-") "P" (dur-date / dur-time / dur-week)
 *
 * dur-date   = dur-day [dur-time]
 * dur-time   = "T" (dur-hour / dur-minute / dur-second)
 * dur-week   = 1*DIGIT "W"
 * dur-hour   = 1*DIGIT "H" [dur-minute]
 * dur-minute = 1*DIGIT "M" [dur-second]
 * dur-second = 1*DIGIT "S"
 * dur-day    = 1*DIGIT "D"
 *
 * Description:  If the property permits, multiple "duration" values are
 * specified by a COMMA-separated list of values.  The format is
 * based on the [ISO.8601.2004] complete representation basic format
 * with designators for the duration of time.  The format can
 * represent nominal durations (weeks and days) and accurate
 * durations (hours, minutes, and seconds).  Note that unlike
 * [ISO.8601.2004], this value type doesn't support the "Y" and "M"
 * designators to specify durations in terms of years and months.
 *
 * The duration of a week or a day depends on its position in the
 * calendar.  In the case of discontinuities in the time scale, such
 * as the change from standard time to daylight time and back, the
 * computation of the exact duration requires the subtraction or
 * addition of the change of duration of the discontinuity.  Leap
 * seconds MUST NOT be considered when computing an exact duration.
 * When computing an exact duration, the greatest order time
 * components MUST be added first, that is, the number of days MUST
 * be added first, followed by the number of hours, number of
 * minutes, and number of seconds.
 *
 * Negative durations are typically used to schedule an alarm to
 * trigger before an associated time (see Section 3.8.6.3).
 *
 * No additional content value encoding (i.e., BACKSLASH character
 * encoding, see Section 3.3.11) are defined for this value type.
 *
 * Example:  A duration of 15 days, 5 hours, and 20 seconds would be:
 *
 * P15DT5H0M20S
 *
 * A duration of 7 weeks would be:
 *
 * P7W
 * </pre>
