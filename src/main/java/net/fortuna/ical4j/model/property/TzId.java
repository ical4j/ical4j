/**
 * $Id$
 * <p/>
 * Created: [Apr 6, 2004]
 * <p/>
 * Defines a TZID iCalendar component property.
 * <p/>
 * <pre>
 *     4.8.3.1 Time Zone Identifier
 *
 *        Property Name: TZID
 *
 *        Purpose: This property specifies the text value that uniquely
 *        identifies the &quot;VTIMEZONE&quot; calendar component.
 *
 *        Value Type: TEXT
 *
 *        Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
 *        specified on this property.
 *
 *        Conformance: This property MUST be specified in a &quot;VTIMEZONE&quot;
 *        calendar component.
 *
 *        Description: This is the label by which a time zone calendar
 *        component is referenced by any iCalendar properties whose data type
 *        is either DATE-TIME or TIME and not intended to specify a UTC or a
 *        &quot;floating&quot; time. The presence of the SOLIDUS character (US-ASCII
 *        decimal 47) as a prefix, indicates that this TZID represents an
 *        unique ID in a globally defined time zone registry (when such
 *        registry is defined).
 *
 *             Note: This document does not define a naming convention for time
 *             zone identifiers. Implementers may want to use the naming
 *             conventions defined in existing time zone specifications such as
 *             the public-domain Olson database [TZ]. The specification of
 *             globally unique time zone identifiers is not addressed by this
 *             document and is left for future study.
 *
 *        Format Definition: This property is defined by the following
 *        notation:
 *
 *          tzid       = &quot;TZID&quot; tzidpropparam &quot;:&quot; [tzidprefix] text CRLF
 *
 *          tzidpropparam      = *(&quot;;&quot; xparam)
 *
 *          ;tzidprefix        = &quot;/&quot;
 *          ; Defined previously. Just listed here for reader convenience.
 *
 *        Example: The following are examples of non-globally unique time zone
 *        identifiers:
 *
 *          TZID:US-Eastern
 *
 *          TZID:California-Los_Angeles
 *
 *        The following is an example of a fictitious globally unique time zone
 *        identifier:
 *
 *          TZID:/US-New_York-New_York
 * </pre>
