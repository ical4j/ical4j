/**
 * $Id$
 * <p/>
 * Created: [Apr 6, 2004]
 * <p/>
 * Defines a UID iCalendar component property.
 * <p/>
 * <pre>
 *     4.8.4.7 Unique Identifier
 *
 *        Property Name: UID
 *
 *        Purpose: This property defines the persistent, globally unique
 *        identifier for the calendar component.
 *
 *        Value Type: TEXT
 *
 *        Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
 *        specified on this property.
 *
 *        Conformance: The property MUST be specified in the &quot;VEVENT&quot;, &quot;VTODO&quot;,
 *        &quot;VJOURNAL&quot; or &quot;VFREEBUSY&quot; calendar components.
 *
 *        Description: The UID itself MUST be a globally unique identifier. The
 *        generator of the identifier MUST guarantee that the identifier is
 *        unique. There are several algorithms that can be used to accomplish
 *        this. The identifier is RECOMMENDED to be the identical syntax to the
 *        [RFC 822] addr-spec. A good method to assure uniqueness is to put the
 *        domain name or a domain literal IP address of the host on which the
 *        identifier was created on the right hand side of the &quot;@&quot;, and on the
 *        left hand side, put a combination of the current calendar date and
 *        time of day (i.e., formatted in as a DATE-TIME value) along with some
 *        other currently unique (perhaps sequential) identifier available on
 *        the system (for example, a process id number). Using a date/time
 *        value on the left hand side and a domain name or domain literal on
 *        the right hand side makes it possible to guarantee uniqueness since
 *        no two hosts should be using the same domain name or IP address at
 *        the same time. Though other algorithms will work, it is RECOMMENDED
 *        that the right hand side contain some domain identifier (either of
 *        the host itself or otherwise) such that the generator of the message
 *        identifier can guarantee the uniqueness of the left hand side within
 *        the scope of that domain.
 *
 *        This is the method for correlating scheduling messages with the
 *        referenced &quot;VEVENT&quot;, &quot;VTODO&quot;, or &quot;VJOURNAL&quot; calendar component.
 *
 *        The full range of calendar components specified by a recurrence set
 *        is referenced by referring to just the &quot;UID&quot; property value
 *        corresponding to the calendar component. The &quot;RECURRENCE-ID&quot; property
 *        allows the reference to an individual instance within the recurrence
 *        set.
 *
 *        This property is an important method for group scheduling
 *        applications to match requests with later replies, modifications or
 *        deletion requests. Calendaring and scheduling applications MUST
 *        generate this property in &quot;VEVENT&quot;, &quot;VTODO&quot; and &quot;VJOURNAL&quot; calendar
 *        components to assure interoperability with other group scheduling
 *        applications. This identifier is created by the calendar system that
 *        generates an iCalendar object.
 *
 *        Implementations MUST be able to receive and persist values of at
 *        least 255 characters for this property.
 *
 *        Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:
 *
 *          uid        = &quot;UID&quot; uidparam &quot;:&quot; text CRLF
 *
 *          uidparam   = *(&quot;;&quot; xparam)
 *
 *        Example: The following is an example of this property:
 *
 *          UID:19960401T080045Z-4000F192713-0052@host1.com
 * </pre>
