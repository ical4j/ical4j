/**
 * $Id$
 * <p/>
 * Created: [Apr 6, 2004]
 * <p/>
 * Defines a SEQUENCE iCalendar component property.
 * <p/>
 * <pre>
 *     4.8.7.4 Sequence Number
 *
 *        Property Name: SEQUENCE
 *
 *        Purpose: This property defines the revision sequence number of the
 *        calendar component within a sequence of revisions.
 *
 *        Value Type: integer
 *
 *        Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
 *        specified on this property.
 *
 *        Conformance: The property can be specified in &quot;VEVENT&quot;, &quot;VTODO&quot; or
 *        &quot;VJOURNAL&quot; calendar component.
 *
 *        Description: When a calendar component is created, its sequence
 *        number is zero (US-ASCII decimal 48). It is monotonically incremented
 *        by the &quot;Organizer's&quot; CUA each time the &quot;Organizer&quot; makes a
 *        significant revision to the calendar component. When the &quot;Organizer&quot;
 *        makes changes to one of the following properties, the sequence number
 *        MUST be incremented:
 *
 *          .  &quot;DTSTART&quot;
 *
 *          .  &quot;DTEND&quot;
 *
 *          .  &quot;DUE&quot;
 *
 *          .  &quot;RDATE&quot;
 *
 *          .  &quot;RRULE&quot;
 *
 *          .  &quot;EXDATE&quot;
 *
 *          .  &quot;EXRULE&quot;
 *
 *          .  &quot;STATUS&quot;
 *
 *        In addition, changes made by the &quot;Organizer&quot; to other properties can
 *        also force the sequence number to be incremented. The &quot;Organizer&quot; CUA
 *        MUST increment the sequence number when ever it makes changes to
 *        properties in the calendar component that the &quot;Organizer&quot; deems will
 *        jeopardize the validity of the participation status of the
 *        &quot;Attendees&quot;. For example, changing the location of a meeting from one
 *        locale to another distant locale could effectively impact the
 *        participation status of the &quot;Attendees&quot;.
 *
 *        The &quot;Organizer&quot; includes this property in an iCalendar object that it
 *        sends to an &quot;Attendee&quot; to specify the current version of the calendar
 *        component.
 *
 *        The &quot;Attendee&quot; includes this property in an iCalendar object that it
 *        sends to the &quot;Organizer&quot; to specify the version of the calendar
 *        component that the &quot;Attendee&quot; is referring to.
 *
 *        A change to the sequence number is not the mechanism that an
 *        &quot;Organizer&quot; uses to request a response from the &quot;Attendees&quot;. The
 *        &quot;RSVP&quot; parameter on the &quot;ATTENDEE&quot; property is used by the
 *        &quot;Organizer&quot; to indicate that a response from the &quot;Attendees&quot; is
 *        requested.
 *
 *        Format Definition: This property is defined by the following
 *        notation:
 *
 *          seq = &quot;SEQUENCE&quot; seqparam &quot;:&quot; integer CRLF
 *          ; Default is &quot;0&quot;
 *
 *          seqparam   = *(&quot;;&quot; xparam)
 *
 *        Example: The following is an example of this property for a calendar
 *        component that was just created by the &quot;Organizer&quot;.
 *
 *          SEQUENCE:0
 *
 *        The following is an example of this property for a calendar component
 *        that has been revised two different times by the &quot;Organizer&quot;.
 *
 *          SEQUENCE:2
 * </pre>
