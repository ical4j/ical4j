/**
 * $Id$
 * <p/>
 * Created: [Apr 6, 2004]
 * <p/>
 * Defines a DTSTAMP iCalendar component property.
 * <p/>
 * <pre>
 *     4.8.7.2 Date/Time Stamp
 *
 *        Property Name: DTSTAMP
 *
 *        Purpose: The property indicates the date/time that the instance of
 *        the iCalendar object was created.
 *
 *        Value Type: DATE-TIME
 *
 *        Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
 *        specified on this property.
 *
 *        Conformance: This property MUST be included in the &quot;VEVENT&quot;, &quot;VTODO&quot;,
 *        &quot;VJOURNAL&quot; or &quot;VFREEBUSY&quot; calendar components.
 *
 *        Description: The value MUST be specified in the UTC time format.
 *
 *        This property is also useful to protocols such as [IMIP] that have
 *        inherent latency issues with the delivery of content. This property
 *        will assist in the proper sequencing of messages containing iCalendar
 *        objects.
 *
 *        This property is different than the &quot;CREATED&quot; and &quot;LAST-MODIFIED&quot;
 *        properties. These two properties are used to specify when the
 *        particular calendar data in the calendar store was created and last
 *        modified. This is different than when the iCalendar object
 *        representation of the calendar service information was created or
 *        last modified.
 *
 *        Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:
 *
 *          dtstamp    = &quot;DTSTAMP&quot; stmparam &quot;:&quot; date-time CRLF
 *
 *          stmparam   = *(&quot;;&quot; xparam)
 * </pre>
