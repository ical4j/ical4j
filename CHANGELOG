0.9.13:

 - Merged DateRange functionality into Period
 
 - Merged DateRangeNormalizer functionality into PeriodList
 
 - Removed Calendar.getEventDateRanges() (use VFreeBusy request instead)
 
 - Removed VEvent.getDateRanges() (use VEvent.getConsumedTime() instead)

 - Applied patches where possible: #1197119, #1191253, #1185766 - thanks tobli
 
 - Default charset for CalendarBuilder and CalendarOutputter now UTF-8 (as per
 RFC2445, section 4.1.4)
 
 - Applied patch from bug #1203990 to Recur.getAbsWeekDays()
 

0.9.12:

 - Redefined parameter and property constants to class instances rather
 than strings. This is done for efficiency where class instances are immutable
 once created. Note: this may cause incompatibilities with existing code!
 
 - fixed bug in parsing periods
 
 - fixed bug in TimeZoneUtils for non-DST timezones
 
 - added support for removal of extraneous newlines between components in the
 default parser implementation (KOrganizer generates such files)
 
 - fixed bug in parsing free time where durations are specified
 
 - Various constants reimplemented as typed instances (as opposed to strings)

 - Applied patch #1170060 by calibre. Provides improvements to retrieval of
 date ranges represented by recurring VEvents.
 
 - documentation updated to conform to XHTML 1.0
 
 - added Base64 encoding/decoding to Attach property
 
 
0.9.11:

 - Better support and usability for recurrence rules. (see
 extensive changes to Recur class)
 
 - Convenience constructors for components VAlarm, VEvent, VFreeBusy, VJournal,
 and VToDo should make it easier to construct standard components.
 
 - Further validation fine-tuning to ensure some properties don't occur where
 not applicable.
 
 - Fixed support for TRANSP property, which was previously being ignored by the
 CalendarBuilder.
 
 
0.9.10:

 parser implementations to be used with iCal4j.
 
 - All properties are now mutable with default constructors.


0.9.8:

 - Added special character escaping and parsing. NOTE: I've provided the ability
 to escape parameter values although I am unsure it is necessary (or allowed) by
 RFC2445.

 cases.
 

0.9.7:
 
 - Added convenience constructors to model classes (Calendar, Component, Property)

 VALUE parameter correctly to identify DATE type for date-time values
 
 - Added validating option to CalendarOutputter to indicate whether to
 validate the Calendar before outputting
 
 - Added recurse parameter to calendar and component validate methods
 to indicate whether to validate children
 
 - Added license header to all source files (hence the increase in size
 of the distribution!)


0.9.5:

 - Added UTC flag to date-time properties indicating how date-time values are formatted
	NOTE: This is not provided for all properties as some must be in UTC format.
