 iCal4j - Changes
==================

0.9.10:

 - Model classes are now Serializable
 
 
0.9.9:

 - Separated the calendar parser from the builder to allow different
 parser implementations to be used with iCal4j.
 
 - All properties are now mutable with default constructors.

0.9.8:

 - Added special character escaping and parsing. NOTE: I've provided the ability
 to escape parameter values although I am unsure it is necessary (or allowed) by
 RFC2445.
 
 - Fixed bug whereby CalendarBuilder wasn't reading quoted text correctly in all
 cases.
 

0.9.7:
 
 - Added convenience constructors to model classes (Calendar, Component, Property)

 - Fixed bug where builder would hang if calendar streams didn't
 contain an extra whitespace char at EOF


0.9.6:

 - Fixed bug found in some property constructors where was not checking
 VALUE parameter correctly to identify DATE type for date-time values
 
 - Added validating option to CalendarOutputter to indicate whether to
 validate the Calendar before outputting
 
 - Added recurse parameter to calendar and component validate methods
 to indicate whether to validate children
 
 - Added license header to all source files (hence the increase in size
 of the distribution!)


0.9.5:

 - Added UTC flag to date-time properties indicating how date-time values are formatted
	NOTE: This is not provided for all properties as some must be in UTC format.

 - Added convenience methods for creating VTimeZone instances.
 
 
0.9.4:

 - Property and Parameter made abstract classes
 
 - Added getValue() implementation to all Property and Parameter sub-classes
 
 - Fixed FoldingWriter
 
 - Other fixes regarding string representations
